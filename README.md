# Geeko Line Follower

## Library Installation ðŸ“š

We have written a library to give you a kickstart. It will save you time from writing your sketch from scratch. Let's install the library!

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure that you have your Arduino IDE installed. If you haven't done so, download and install the software from the Arduino website: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/

### Installation Steps

2. **Download the library as zip file**
   
   https://github.com/ardugeekph/geeko-raptor/tree/main

3. **Unpack the zip file** 
   
   You should be able to see `libraries` and `hardware` folders

4. **Copy the hardware folder**
   
   Copy the `hardware` folder to `Documents â†’ Arduino â†’ *here*`

5. **Copy the library folder**
   
   Copy the `geeko-raptor-main â†’ libraries â†’ geeko_raptor` to `Documents â†’ Arduino â†’ libraries â†’ *here*`

6. **Verify installation**
   
   Open up your Arduino IDE and you should be able to see:
   - The `Geeko Board` from `Tools > Board`
   - The geeko_raptor library from the `Sketch Examples` from `File â†’ Examples â†’ geeko_raptor`
